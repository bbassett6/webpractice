        <h3>
            Stabilizers
        </h3>
        <p1>
            All of the long keys on a keyboard like the space bar and shift keys require stabilizers. There are many different kinds but the ones you should look out for are genuine cherry screw-ins, durocks, and c3 equalz. Even though these are the top types you will still want to tune and lube them to get the smoothest feel and least sound. You want the stabs to be as unintrusive as possible so that your case and switches can shine. Make sure you get some dielectric grease to lube the housings of the stabs. lubing stabs is one of the most effective mods you can do to your keyboard to instantly make it sound better. Stock stabilizers can be rattly and scratchy and they can take away from the typing experience of the board.

        <h3>
            PCBs 
        </h3>
        <p1>
            Your pcb, the circuit board, can be either hotswap or soldered. While there are no major advantages to either, hotswap is more convenient for beginners. A hotswap pcb comes with sockets for every switch that allow you to swap switches in and out without soldering and desoldering. Some people claim that soldering can make the switches feel more solid but in my experience, you will be happy with either.

        <h3>
            Bluetooth
        </h3>
        <p1>
            Some pcbs will come with Bluetooth functionality though it can vary in ease of use. Some will be fully functional out of the box and some will require you to solder an antennae and battery and controller.
