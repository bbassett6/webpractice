            If you like a little bit more feedback when you type, you should build with tactile switches. A tactile switch has a small bump in the middle that you have to get over in order to actuate the switch. This offers a real feel of when the key is pressed and produces a different sound profile.

            Most users will lube their tactile switches as well. The key with tactiles is to not lube the legs of the switch. All of the tactility comes from the legs on the leaf so you have to be extra careful.<br><br>
            Typically tribosys 3204 is used for tactile switches.
