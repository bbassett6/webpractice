        The mechanical keyboard hobby can be very rewarding if you are careful and patient. Getting to know the different markets and formats of sales is key.
    <br><br>
        The first and most important thing to understand is that not everything is sold in stock. Most high end keyboard parts are sold in a "Group Buy." This means that a person or vendor will ask the community if they are interested in a certain product and willing to pay in advance and as a group in order to get the best value from manufacturers. Manufacturing just a single set of keycaps or a single keyboard is expensive, so if there is a whole group of people who want that keycap set or that board, the manufacturer can save money by producing multiple at once. 
    <br><br>
        The only downside is lead time. The manufacturer needs the money upfront in order to begin manufacturing the items. For the user, this means paying up to a year in advance and paitiently waiting for the product to be produces, shipped to the vendor, and then shipped to you. 
    <br><br>
        If you miss a groupbuy, you can usually find the item on the mech market though it will be resold for a significant markup.

    <br><br>
        There are however websites that will sell mechanical keyboard components in stock. Sites like novelkeys and kbdfans have a variety of in stock parts that are great for beginners and enthusiasts alike.

        First you will want to decide on a budget. This hobby can get really expensive really fast so try to set your budget slightly below what you are actually willing to spend. Shipping and fees will add up in the end. 
        You can spend anywhere from $100 to $5000 on keyboard paraphernalia depending on how committed/crazy you are. The keyboard community praises boards based on their sound and typing feel as well as looks. the highest priced boards on the mech market are hyped to oblivion, commanding prices of up to $5000 for just a barebones keyboard. That is the extreme end, however. For only $150 you too can build your own custom mechanical keyboard.

    <h3>
        Keycaps
    </h3>
    <p1>
        There are hundreds of companies that make keycaps and the prices can be anywhere from $20 for a set to several hundred. First you ned to choose the type of plastic you want. There are two main options: ABS and PBT. The crowd favorite keycap manufacturer of the keyboard community is GMK. They produce the highest quality abs keycaps on the market with the highest quality colors. Abs is easier to work with, but if tends to shine more frequently. That is, as you use the keycaps, your finger oils will begin to remove the subtle texture on the caps rendering them shiny. Many people don't like this and choose to go with the other plastic option: pbt. Pbt is much more durable but it is harder to color and can be harder to get clean legends on. At the end of the day it all comes down to preference. You should choose the keycaps that look the nicest to you because you are the end user. You are creating this keyboard for your own enjoyment and that is the most important.<br><br>
