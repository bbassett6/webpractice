            If you are pure gamer and want the most noise possible, buy clicky switches. Depending on what switch you buy you can have anywhere from a lawnmower to an f-16 right at your fingertips. The enthusiast scene tends to look down on clicky switches, but mechanical keyboards are meant to make you happy so if you like the click, get the click.
