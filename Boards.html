            Once you have decided on a size, you need to choose the mounting type. The way the plate and pcb are mounted have a huge effect on the typing sound. Typically the cheapest style is tray mount. While they may be cheap, they can still offer great performance. Many enthusiasts will pack foam into the case or remove mounting points to offer more flex and remove the hollow sound.

            If you want to spend more, you can get a top mount board. Top mounting the plate spreads the force of typing out across the plate more evenly. If you want to spend even more you can get types of gasket mounts that spread out the flex even more and offer an even more pleasant sound.<br>

            There are also different materials to choose from for cases. A majority of the cases on the market are made of solid aluminum. This gives the case good heft on your desk but it can also cause the sound to be higher pitched or hollow depending on how you build it.

            If you want a deeper sound you can go with a polycarbonate or acrylic case. It will lead to a sound with more "thocc" which is highly coveted in the mech community. There are also steel and brass options if you want to pay much much more.
